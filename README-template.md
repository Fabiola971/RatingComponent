## My process

I drafted on a paper all the Html components. After I was sure, Istarted to build my Html page. I recovered every colors of the project to put in css folder.
I used the colors, styles to custom my project as close as possible to the design preview. I used medis queries for mobile design.
Then I finished with Javascript coding, Ihad difficulties because I would used a animation to translate my Thanks box, finally I used a transition.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first 
- Javascript

### What I learned

I'm totally happy with my entire code.
I can see my improvements it's seems better than beginning.
I know it's not perfect but I continue to train on the platform and the best is coming.
